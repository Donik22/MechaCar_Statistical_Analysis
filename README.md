## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Vehicle_length & ground clearance had a very low probability of providing a random amount of variance to the mpg values dataset.
- Since the p-value of the linear regresion model is 5.35e-11 We can reject the null hypothesis and accept that the slope of the model is not equal to Zero or There is a corrolation between our variables.
- given that our R-squared is 0.7149. 72% of the variance can be explained by our model. The model Explains mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

As Seen in the above images, The current manufacturing data meets the design specification for all maufacturing lots in total Although When it comes to indivisual lots, The Data from lot 3 does not meet the specification. It appears lot 3 data is a great factor in the total high variance while the data from the other 2 lots remained below 10 PSI.
