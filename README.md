## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Vehicle_length & ground clearance had a very low probability of providing a random amount of variance to the mpg values dataset.
- Since the p-value of the linear regresion model is 5.35e-11 We can reject the null hypothesis and accept that the slope of the model is not equal to Zero or There is a corrolation between our variables.
- given that our R-squared is 0.7149. 72% of the variance can be explained by our model. The model Explains mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
